# zsh-dotfiles
Simple, complete and fast zsh configuration without all those overly complex bundling systems.
Each from the few necessary plugins is used as git submodule.

Dotfiles should be placed in `.zsh` directory and loaded from `.zshrc` as `source ~/.zsh/main.sh`.
We can customise configs locally used `.zsh/local.sh` file.
